# veild

Stub resolver for routing DNS queries over TLS (DNS-over-TLS).

Thanks to the following sites/RFCs:

- [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035)
- [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7858](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7858)
- [https://dnsprivacy.org/wiki/display/DP/DNS+Privacy+Test+Servers](https://dnsprivacy.org/wiki/display/DP/DNS+Privacy+Test+Servers)

## Features

- Roundrobin of requests over each DNS server
- Caches responses and adhers to TTLs
- Blacklist domains using a supplied file (txt file of domains to block)
- Ability to define a list of resolvers in a YAML file

## Install

[Head on over to the latest releases page](https://github.com/jamesduncombe/veild/releases) to pick up your release of choice :)

## Usage

The quickest and easiest way to get started, assuming you've extracted the archieve and are in the directory:

```sh
sudo ./veild
```

This will start `veild` with caching on and a resolvers set to [Cloudflare's](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/dns-over-tls/) `1.1.1.1` and `1.0.0.1`.

Why do I need sudo?! Well, by default veild listens on port `53` (UDP) which is within the priveledged ports range... more on that [here](https://www.w3.org/Daemon/User/Installation/PrivilegedPorts.html).

Hopefully you should see it startup with output similar to the following:

```sh
$ sudo ./veild
2018/09/06 16:59:03 Starting Veil
2018/09/06 16:59:03 [main] Outbound port set to 853
2018/09/06 16:59:03 [main] Listening on 127.0.0.1:53 (UDP)
```

If you do... good stuff!

Time to set your resolver to your nice, new, fresh super secureâ„¢ resolver.

- [Windows instructions](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-change-dns-servers-in-windows-2626242)

When your OS is set to use veild you should start to see some activity in the console.

### Resolvers

The `resolvers.yml` file which you'll see in the archieve also gives you the ability to enable/disable DNS resolvers as needed. I've added comments in there which should explain things.

### Outbound port

You can specify an outbound port (instead of the default `853` DNS-over-TLS port) by using the `-p` flag when starting veild.

Using the `-p` flag filters down the resolvers in the `resolvers.yml` file to the specified port.

### Blacklists

Blacklist support is also available to block ad domains etc. For that you'll need to head to [Steven Black's repo](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts) where you can find multiple blacklists available for download.

Veild is happy working with the hosts file format, so, once you have a blacklist downloaded, simply add: `-b blacklist.txt` to the end of the command above.


I think that just about covers things... for a full set of the arguments that you can pass to veild run: `./veild --help`

## Todo

- Limit size of cache
- Add ability to remap domain requests
